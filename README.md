# Local Weather
This repository is for a webpage that will report local weather for a given location.

This project is from @freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front-End Development Projects. I started it on CodePen, but decided to move it over to GitHub so I can expand on the project. I noticed that testing this project was tricky because I needed to use specific latitude/longitude values to check varying weather conditions and decided to use this as an opportunity to learn about testing. I also would like to practice media queries, so I felt that it had veered far enough away from meeting the user stories from the project requirements to deserve its own repository.
