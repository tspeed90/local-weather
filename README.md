# REAL-TIME WEATHER DISPLAY | FINANCIAL TIMES

The website should:

- Display weather for the user's current location
- Allow the user to choose the city you're getting the weather from
- Not rely heavily on client-side frameworks (ie. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery

For bonus points, the website could:

- Be accessible
- Be responsive
- Be server side rendered
- Be progressively enhanced
- Be built using javascript and node.js
- Be deployed on Heroku
- Be performant over 3G networks
- Use Origami Components
- Work offline
