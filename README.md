See it here: https://hows-the-weather.netlify.com

### User Story: 
- I can see the weather in my current location. 
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### Want to add:
- Testing
- More icons (maybe better icons?)
- Different background images
- More accessibility
